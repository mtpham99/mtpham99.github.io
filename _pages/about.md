My name is Matthew Pham, and I am currently a PhD student in the Prtizker School of Molecular Engineering ([PME](https://pme.uchicago.edu/)) at The University of Chicago ([UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)). I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Iowa State University ([ISU](https://www.physastro.iastate.edu/)) in Spring of 2021. Currently, I work in the Computational Materials Group at Argonne National Lab ([ANL](https://www.anl.gov/msd/computational-materials)) under the supervision of Dr. Marco Govoni and Professor Giulia Galli. We utilize first principles methods, e.g. density functional theory (DFT), to study materials and material defects and their applications in quantum information science.

In my free time enjoy watching movies and playing chess. Although I no longer frequently compete in chess tournaments, every now and then I play online at [Lichess.com](https://lichess.org/@/Obsequious), which I greatly prefer over [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mafumafu)
