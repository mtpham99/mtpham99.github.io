My name is Matthew Pham, and I am currently a PhD student in the Prtizker School of Molecular Engineering ([PME](https://pme.uchicago.edu/)) at The University of Chicago ([UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)). I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Iowa State University ([ISU](https://www.physastro.iastate.edu/)) in Spring of 2021. Currently, I work in the Computational Materials Group at Argonne National Lab ([ANL](https://www.anl.gov/msd/computational-materials)) under the supervision of Dr. Marco Govoni and Professor Giullia Galli. We utilize first principles methods, e.g. density functional theory (DFT), to study materials and material defects and their applications in quantum information science. Due to the computational nature of this work, another large component of this research is the developement of scalable, high performance computing (HPC) simulation tools.

I enjoy spending most of my free time watching movies and playing chess. [Here](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur137170392/ratings) you can see a subset of dubious ratings I have given to movies I've watched because I have both questionable organizational skills and taste. Although I no longer frequently compete in chess tournaments, every now and then I play online at [Lichess.com](https://lichess.org/@/Obsequious), which is in fact better than [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/mafumafu) according to the aforementioned questionable taste. I also  enjoy eating and trying new foods, but I suppose that isn't really a hobby.
